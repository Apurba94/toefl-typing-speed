# Typing for TOEFL

TOEFL writing is typed. Build speed and accuracy with academic sentences.

Part of the [GRE and TOEFL Study Suite](https://github.com/Apurba94/gre-toefl-study-suite): 100 free study apps for the TOEFL iBT and more. It works offline, as a Windows program or in the browser.

## Download and run

- **Windows:** download `Typing for TOEFL.exe` from the [latest release](https://github.com/Apurba94/toefl-typing-speed/releases/latest) and open it. Nothing to install. It opens in its own window and saves your progress in your user folder.
- **Browser:** open it online in the suite's web edition at https://gre-toefl-study-suite.vercel.app/apps/toefl-typing-speed/ . Progress stays in that browser.
- **From source:** `python launcher.py` (Python 3.10 or later, no packages needed).

## What it does

All TOEFL writing is typed, so slow typing costs ideas. Type original academic sentences as fast and accurately as you can. The app measures words per minute (five characters to a word) and word accuracy, and charts your progress.

Sections: Practice, Progress, About.

## How to use it

1. Press **Start** in **Practice** and type the sentences shown.
2. Press **Done** when you finish. Accuracy matters more than speed at first.
3. Aim for 35 words per minute or more with 95% accuracy.

## Good to know

- All questions, passages and definitions were written for this suite. None are official ETS questions. For official practice, use the materials on ets.org.
- It follows the GRE General Test as shortened in September 2023 and the TOEFL iBT as updated in January 2026. Formats change, so check ets.org before your test.
- Feedback on writing and speaking counts things a program can count honestly, such as length and linking words. It does not give an official score.
- Not endorsed by or affiliated with ETS. GRE and TOEFL are registered trademarks of ETS.

## For developers

The app is plain HTML and JavaScript in `web/`, run by a small Python launcher that serves it on 127.0.0.1 only and needs a secret token for saving. Tests: `node --test "tests/*.test.js"` (23 tests) and `python -m unittest discover -s tests`. Build the .exe with `python build_exe.py`.
